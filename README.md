 Integrated Affectiva’s and Zoom’s SDKs in a third party web application, and added a real time graph at a user’s end of his emotions and engagements levels, and one to the host with the average levels amongst all the members, as well as a summary report at the end of the meeting sent to the host. The project aims to help increase the engagement levels of students during zoom conference calls.
